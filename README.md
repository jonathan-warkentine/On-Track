  ## Description:

  This app templatizes and automates the README generation process. Instead of the pain of trying to put together a good README, the user can get straight to work on their project and let this open source magic do its thing!

  ## Installation:

  You must have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine in order to run this app. Run the command `npm i` to install dependencies, which include:
- [ ] console.table
- [ ] mysql2
- [ ] dotenv
- [ ] inquirer
- [ ] asciiart-logo

In addition, you must have [MySQL installed](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) on your machine, with at least one database. 

  &nbsp;

  ## Usage:
  

  This app connects to a MySQL database via the mysql2 npm package. The connection is managed via a .env file, but this is abstracted through a series of setup prompts.
